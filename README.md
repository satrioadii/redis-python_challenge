# redis-python_challenge
This microservice simulation project is a project to understand the basics of microservice. This project builds using Redis and Python. The case exists in this project is 5000 requests from the client sequentially and the service provider must process every data with limited resources. Hence, we need to separate the service to a different place and each data will be processed in different Data Processor. “Center” job is only as a data passer connected between client's data and the Data Processors. After the data processed, the client will receive the data directly from the “Center”.

The image above that I have shown is the documentation of this project. The first image is the concept I design and development in this project. This concept enables us to add Data Processor only through the Data Processor without more settings in the Center. The second image is documentation about turned on the Redis-server. The third image is the results of the Center while receiving 5000 data from Clients. It shows the total data available and the data received. The fourth image is the process that happened in the client's window after the data processed. The client’s window shows the processed data received from the Center. The last image is the Data Processor window. Each data processor handled connected to a different channel and handled with a different thread. The Data Processor requests the data every user press “Enter” and it will process the data, then send it back to Center.
